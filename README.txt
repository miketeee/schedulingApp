Custom Report: The custom report that I created is based on the premise that the
	       company using the software has a first shift and second shift of 
               employees. The end of the first shift is at 3pm eastern standard time.
	       The appointments that occur before 3pm are categorized and first shift
	       appointments. The shifts that occur after 3pm are categorized as                      second shift appointments. Users will be able to see what appointments
	       occur during their shift. This feature will allow them to plan their 
	       daily workflow more appropriately by using data that is specific to 	       their shift.
